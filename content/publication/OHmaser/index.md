abstract: We present results of the high angular resolution survey of the OH ground state masers in galactic star forming regions, with the goal to study broadening of the maser spots by interstellar scattering. The angular size of the maser spots in 39 galactic maser sources was measured with milliarcsecond resolution using the VLBA in snap- shot mode. The angular size of the spots in maser regions with large broadening is roughly the same. In maser regions with compact spots the size varies by almost an order of magnitude. We found that the maser spots are broadened by the interstellar scattering by an average amount which is consistent with the broadening results for compact extragalactic sources. The distribution of the scattering is highly non-uniform. In the Galactic plane there are directions of very low scattering (’voids’), and towards the inner Galaxy in several lines of sight the scattering is anomalously high.
